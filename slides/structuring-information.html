</ul>

<section>
<h3>Card Sorting</h3>
<img alt='' src='structuring-information-content/card-sorting.jpg'>
<p class='note'>
In a card sort, a user is provided with a set of terms, and asked to
categorize them. In a closed card sort, the user is also given the category
names; in an open card sort the user creates whatever categories they
feel are most appropriate.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Card Sorting</h3>
<p class='note'>
The goal of a card sort is to explore relationships between content, and
better understand the hierarchies that a user perceives. Many content
strategists and information architects rely on card sorts to test out
hierarchy theories, or kickstart work on a site map.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Tree Tests</h3>
<img alt='' src='structuring-information-content/tree-testing.png'>
<p class='note'>
Users are given a task and shown the top level of a site map.
Then they are asked to talk through where they would go to accomplish the
task. However, the user doesn’t see a screen when they choose a site section.
Instead, they will see the next level of the architecture.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Tree Tests</h3>
<p class='note'>
The goal is to identify whether information is categorized correctly and how
appropriately the nomenclature reflects the sections of the&nbsp;site.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Gather content</h2>
<p class='note'>
A content inventory is the process and the result of cataloging the entire
contents of a website. An allied practice —a content audit— is the process of
evaluating that content.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Content inventory</h3>
<p class='note'>
A content inventory typically includes all information assets on a website,
such as web pages (html), meta elements (e.g., keywords, description, page
title), images, audio and video files, and document&nbsp;files.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Content inventory</h3>
<p class='note'>
A content inventory is a quantitative analysis of a website. It simply logs
what is on a website. The content inventory will answer the question: “What
is there?” and can be the start of a website review.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Content audit</h3>
<p class='note'>
A content audit is an accounting of all currently published web content.
It is a qualitative analysis of information assets on a website.
</p>
<p class='note'>
Content audit can answer five questions: What content do we already have?;
Who is making this content?; How do people find it?; How is it performing?;
and Is the content current (accurate) or&nbsp;outdated?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Prioritise content</h2>
<p class='note'>
After the content audit, the content list is ordered by priority. This
prioritisation will lead the information architecture and visual design.
</p>
<p class='note'>
The card sorting technique is sometimes used here to rearrange the content
in an intuitive&nbsp;way.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Sketch some wireframes</h2>
<img alt='' src='structuring-information-content/wireframe.png'>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Wireframes</h3>
<p class='note'>
Wireframes are schematical draws of a website. They can be done on paper or
with design software, and can be very rough or detailed, depending on the needs
of the design&nbsp;process.
</p>
<p class='note'>
They focus on information arrangement and are helpful for quickly share ideas
with team members and clients. They will lead visual design and development.
</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<li>Pencil, paper and post-it notes</li>
<li>A spreadsheet (helpful for content inventories)</li>

(task and issue manager, but also helpful for card sorting and content
prioritisation).
