<h1>Introduction to the&nbsp;WWW</h1>
</section>
<section>
<h2>What is the Internet?</h2>
</section>
<section>
<p class='note'>
It's the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet
protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>How old is the Internet?</h2>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='Arpanet logical map, 1977' src='introduction-web-content/arpanet.png'>
<p class='note'>
Its origins date back to 1969, when the first computer connection, known as
ARPANET, was established between three universities in&nbsp;California.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>What is the WWW?</h2>
</section>
<section>
<p class='note'>
It is a system of distribution of hypertext or hypermedia documents
interconnected and accessible through the&nbsp;Internet.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>How old is the WWW?</h2>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='Primer servidor web' src='introduction-web-content/first-web-server.jpg'>
<p class='note'>
The Web was developed between March 1989 and December 1990, by the Englishman
Tim Berners-Lee with the help of Belgian Robert Cailliau while working at
CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.

<h2>What is a website made of?</h2>
</section>
<section>
<pre><code class='html'>&lt;html&gt; Content &lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p class='note'>
HTML: contents and structure.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<pre><code class='css'>.css{&#x000A;  color: pink;&#x000A;}</code></pre>
<p class='note'>
CSS: visual appearance.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<pre><code class='js'>var numTotal = 4;&#x000A;if( numTotal > 3 ){&#x000A;  alert("Javascript!");&#x000A;}</code></pre>
<p class='note'>
JavaScript: behaviour/programming.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>What happens when accessing a&nbsp;website?</h2>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/server.png'>
<p class='note'>
To publish a website we need to host the necessary files on a computer
permanently connected to the Internet, with specific software and a physical
address, an IP (example: 79.153.70.215).
</p>
<p class='note'>
We will hire this service, known as <i>hosting</i>, to specialized
companies, paying an annual rent.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/icann.jpg'>
<p class='note'>
In addition, we need to hire a domain (also annual rent). The Internet
domains are centralized in a registry controlled by the non-profit association
ICANN, and allow you to associate a name and extension (www.example.com, .net, .org â€¦)
with the IP of a&nbsp;server.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/browser-address.png'>
<p class='note'>
When we enter an address in the browser (or follow a link), the browser
checks the IP associated with the domain and contacts the&nbsp;server.
</p>
<p class='note'>
Through the rest of the address, the server software knows what HTML file to
return. When we access the root of the domain (www.example.com), the server
usually shows the index.html file, the home&nbsp;page.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/web-no-styles.png'>
<p class='note'>
The browser downloads a text file (HTML), which has information about its
contents, but also information about the dependent files (images, stylesheets
and JavaScript scripts).
</p>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/web-with-styles.png'>
<p class='note'>
Once it has downloaded images and stylesheets (CSS), it has enough
information to display the page in the format we&nbsp;expected.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<div class='img-collage'>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/web-with-js.png'>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/web-with-js-2.png'>
</div>
<p class='note'>
And once it has downloaded and interpreted the JavaScript, it can add
advanced interaction to the page (which initially does not differ much from
a Word&nbsp;document).
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>How has the WWW evolved?</h2>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/timbl.png'>
<p class='note'>
The WWW was developed between 1989 and 1990, and was published in&nbsp;1992.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<a href='http://www.spacejam.com' target='_blank'>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/spacejam.png'>
</a>
<p class='note'>
Websites with basic styles were developed using HTML styling tags and very
limited&nbsp;interaction.
</p>
<p class='note'>
<a href="http://www.spacejam.com" target="_blank">Space Jam website</a>,
published in 1996.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p class='note'>
In 1995 the first version of JavaScript was launched, which would allow you to
add programming instructions that are interpreted directly in the browser,
and thus achieve much more interactive&nbsp;websites.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p class='note'>
In 1996, the first version of CSS, or <i> Cascading Style Sheets </i>, was launched,
the styling language that would allow separating the content (HTML) from the
visual presentation.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/crt.jpg'>
<p class='note'>
For several years, the web was the property of the desktop computer, whose
monitors were gaining size and resolution, but they were quite&nbsp;uniform.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/iphone.png'>
<p class='note'>
In 2007 the iPhone was released, the first smartphone, and suddenly we were
forced to create a website that can also work on these devices (and those
that will come).
</p>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/rwd.png'>
<p class='note'>
In 2010 Ethan Marcotte conceived the Responsive Web Design, a set of
techniques and rules for developing websites that adapt to different devices.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/react.png'>
<p class='note'>
Between 2010 and 2014, frameworks such as Angular, React or Vue were created,
based on JavaScript and designed to create web apps: websites with high
interaction in the browser without reloading the&nbsp;page.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p class='note'>
The popularization of these libraries and the complexity of the developments
and tools changed the paradigm of how we view web&nbsp;sites.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/interface.png'>
<p class='note'>
We no longer talk about pages, but components.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<img alt='' src='introduction-web-content/components.png'>
<p class='note'>
We identify the elements that compose and repeat throughout an interface, we
isolate them and centralize their design and&nbsp;development.
