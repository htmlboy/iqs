  %h3 Card Sorting
  %img(src="structuring-information-content/card-sorting.jpg" alt="")
  %p.note
    In a card sort, a user is provided with a set of terms, and asked to
    categorize them. In a closed card sort, the user is also given the category
    names; in an open card sort the user creates whatever categories they
    feel are most appropriate.

%section
  %h3 Card Sorting
  %p.note
    The goal of a card sort is to explore relationships between content, and
    better understand the hierarchies that a user perceives. Many content
    strategists and information architects rely on card sorts to test out
    hierarchy theories, or kickstart work on a site map.

%section
  %h3 Tree Tests
  %img(src="structuring-information-content/tree-testing.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    Users are given a task and shown the top level of a site map.
    Then they are asked to talk through where they would go to accomplish the
    task. However, the user doesn’t see a screen when they choose a site section.
    Instead, they will see the next level of the architecture.
%section
  %h3 Tree Tests
  %p.note
    The goal is to identify whether information is categorized correctly and how
    accurately the nomenclature reflects the sections of the&nbsp;site.


%section
  %h2 Gather content
  %p.note
    A content inventory is the process and the result of cataloging the entire
    contents of a website. An allied practice —a content audit— is the process of
    evaluating that content.

%section
  %h3 Content inventory
  %p.note
    A content inventory typically includes all information assets on a website,
    such as web pages (html), meta elements (e.g., keywords, description, page
    title), images, audio and video files, and document&nbsp;files.
%section
  %h3 Content inventory
  %p.note
    A content inventory is a quantitative analysis of a website. It simply logs
    what is on a website. The content inventory will answer the question: “What
    is there?” and can be the start of a website review.
%section
  %h3 Content audit
  %p.note
    A content audit is an accounting of all currently published web content.
    It is a qualitative analysis of information assets on a website.
  %p.note
    Content audit can answer five questions: What content do we already have?;
    Who is making this content?; How do people find it?; How is it performing?;
    and Is the content current (accurate) or&nbsp;outdated?

%section
  %h2 Prioritise content
  %p.note
    After the content audit, the content list is ordered by priority. This
    prioritisation will lead the information architecture and visual design.
  %p.note
    The card sorting technique is sometimes used here to rearrange the content
    in an intuitive&nbsp;way.

%section
  %h2 Sketch some wireframes
  %img(src="structuring-information-content/wireframe.png" alt="")

%section
  %h3 Wireframes
  %p.note
    Wireframes are schematical draws of a website. They can be done on paper or
    with design software, and can be very rough or detailed, depending on the needs
    of the design&nbsp;process.
  %p.note
    They focus on information arrangement and are helpful to quickly share ideas
    with team members and clients. They will lead visual design and development.
