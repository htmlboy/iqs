  %h1 Introduction to the&nbsp;WWW

%section
  %h2 What is the Internet?

%section
  %p.note
    It's the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet
    protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.

%section
  %h2 How old is the Internet?

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/arpanet.png" alt="Arpanet logical map, 1977")
  %p.note
    Its origins date back to 1969, when the first computer connection, known as
    ARPANET, was established between three universities in&nbsp;California.
%section
  %h2 What is the WWW?
%section
  %p.note
    It is a system of distribution of hypertext or hypermedia documents
    interconnected and accessible through the&nbsp;Internet.
%section

  %img(src="introduction-web-content/first-web-server.jpg" alt="Primer servidor web")
  %p.note
    The Web was developed between March 1989 and December 1990, by
    Tim Berners-Lee with the help of Robert Cailliau while working at
    CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.

  %p.note
    %a(href="https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/" target="_blank")
      First web page and first browser (recreation)

%section
  %h2 What is a website made of?
%section
  %pre
    %code.html
      &lt;html&gt; Content &lt;/html&gt;
  %p.note
    HTML: contents and structure.
%section
  %pre
    %code.css
      :preserve
        .css{
          color: pink;
        }
  %p.note
    CSS: visual appearance.
%section
  %pre
    %code.js
      :preserve
        var numTotal = 4;
        if( numTotal > 3 ){
          alert("Javascript!");
        }
  %p.note
    JavaScript: behaviour/programming.

%section
  %h2 What happens when accessing a&nbsp;website?
%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/server.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    To publish a website we need to host the necessary files on a computer
    permanently connected to the Internet, with specific software and a physical
    address, an IP (example: 79.153.70.215).
  %p.note
    We will hire this service, known as <i>hosting</i>, to specialized
    companies, paying an annual fee.

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/icann.jpg" alt="")
  %p.note
    In addition, we need to hire a domain (also annual fee). The Internet
    domains are centralized in a registry controlled by the non-profit association
    ICANN, and allow you to associate a name and extension (www.example.com, .net, .org â€¦)
    with the IP of a&nbsp;server.

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/browser-address.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    When we enter an address in the browser (or follow a link), the browser
    checks the IP associated with the domain and contacts the&nbsp;server.
  %p.note
    Through the rest of the address, the server software knows what HTML file to
    return. When we access the root of the domain (www.example.com), the server
    usually shows the index.html file, the home&nbsp;page.

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/web-no-styles.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    The browser downloads a text file (HTML), which has information about its
    contents, but also information about the dependent files (images, stylesheets
    and JavaScript scripts).

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/web-with-styles.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    Once it has downloaded images and stylesheets (CSS), it has enough
    information to display the page in the format we&nbsp;expected.

%section
  .img-collage

    %img(src="introduction-web-content/web-with-js-2.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    And once it has downloaded and interpreted the JavaScript, it can add
    advanced interaction to the page (which initially does not differ much from
    a Word&nbsp;document).

%section
  %h2 How has the WWW evolved?

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/timbl.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    The WWW was developed between 1989 and 1990, and was published in&nbsp;1992.

%section
  %a(href="http://www.spacejam.com" target="_blank")
    %img(src="introduction-web-content/spacejam.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    Websites with basic styles were developed using HTML styling tags and very
    limited&nbsp;interaction.
  %p.note
    <a href="http://www.spacejam.com" target="_blank">Space Jam website</a>,
    published in 1996.

%section
  %p.note
    In 1995 the first version of JavaScript was launched, which would allow you to
    add programming instructions that are interpreted directly in the browser,
    and thus achieve much more interactive&nbsp;websites.

%section
  %p.note
    In 1996, the first version of CSS, or <i> Cascading Style Sheets </i>, was launched,
    the styling language that would allow separating the content (HTML) from the
    visual presentation.

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/crt.jpg" alt="")
  %p.note
    For several years, the web was built for the desktop computer. Although
    their size and resolution were increasing, monitors were quite&nbsp;uniform.

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/iphone.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    In 2007 the first smartphone, the iPhone, was released, and suddenly we had
    to create websites that could also work on these devices (and those
    that were to come).

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/rwd.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    In 2010 Ethan Marcotte coined the term Responsive Web Design, a set of
    techniques and rules for developing websites that adapt to different devices.

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/react.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    Between 2010 and 2014, frameworks such as Angular, React or Vue were created,
    based on JavaScript and designed to create web apps: websites with high
    interaction in the browser without reloading the&nbsp;page.

%section
  %p.note
    The popularization of these libraries and the complexity of the developments
    and tools changed the paradigm of how we view web&nbsp;sites.

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/interface.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    We no longer talk about pages, but components.

%section
  %img(src="introduction-web-content/components.png" alt="")
  %p.note
    We identify the elements that compose and repeat throughout an interface, we
    isolate them and centralize their design and&nbsp;development.
